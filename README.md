With the use of software called Flash Bitcoin Transaction (Core Network), you can send fictitious Bitcoin for free from one wallet address to another on the blockchain network (Coinbase, Binance, Blockchain, etc.).

This is a Bitcoin fork that makes it possible to generate Bitcoin transactions on the network. Transactions generated using the flash bitcoin (core network) to any wallet on the blockchain (Coinbase, Binance, Bybit, Localbitcoin, etc.) receive a full confirmation and remain on the network until they are rejected by the network after a maximum of 90 days for basic licenses and 360 days for premium licenses.

With the basic license, you can generate and send up to 1000 Bitcoin every day and up to 10,000 Bitcoin in a single transaction
